# Google-Books-Search

A React-based app that utilizes the googlebooks api to retrieve books based on user input. This can be in the form of a book title or an author name.  The results include: book title, author name, a brief description of the book, and an image of the book cover.

The user has the option to save the book for later review or click on the view button and be redirected to its Google Books page where the user can then read up on more specific information including purchase options.
